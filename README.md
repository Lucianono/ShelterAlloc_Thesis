# Design and Implementation of Shelter Location-Allocation in Calumpit, Bulacan

A decision support system designed to help **Local Government Units** (LGUs) and disaster management agencies in Calumpit, Bulacan like the **Municipal Social Welfare and Development** (MSWDO) and **Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management** (MDRRMO). Using a **Genetic Algorithm** (GA) and the **Bi-level No Transfer** (BNT) Model from Manongas' Paper from the University of the Philippines, the system analyzes community and shelter data to allocate the most efficient shelter locations. It aims to improve disaster preparedness and response by minimizing evacuation time and ensuring that affected populations are directed to the nearest shelters.
