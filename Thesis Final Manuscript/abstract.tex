	The Philippines, being highly vulnerable to disasters such as typhoons and floods, ranks first in the World Risk Index. Among the municipalities of Bulacan, Calumpit is particularly prone to severe flooding. Furthermore, current evacuation system faces challenges such as overcrowding and inefficient resource use. While mathematical models can optimize shelter allocation, they are often inaccessible to decision-makers without mathematical expertise. To address this, a data-driven decision support system was developed. Shelter Location-Allocation System identifies suitable shelters and assigns communities in an optimal manner. The system integrates Bilevel No Transfer (BNT) model, considering distance, cost, capacity, and shelter hierarchy, and applies a genetic algorithm to determine the best allocation strategy. All parameters and data are fully customizable, allowing decision-makers to tailor the system to their needs. The system was evaluated by end-users and IT experts, receiving high acceptability scores, with mean ratings greater than 9.0 across all criteria. These results indicate the systemâ€™s quality in supporting data-driven disaster response planning, offering a scalable solution for improving evacuation strategies in flood-prone areas.
