To protect the participantsâ€™ privacy, all responses will be anonymized and handled with strict confidentiality. Additionally, data usage will be restricted to research purposes only, ensuring that participants' information remains safeguarded throughout the research process and beyond. 

\textbf{Informed Consent:} All respondents are informed about the purpose, procedures, and potential impacts of the study before they agree to participate. The respondents will be given a detailed explanation of the study, including the nature of their involvement, the voluntary nature of participation, and their right to withdraw at any time.

\textbf{Confidentiality and Anonymity:} Personal identifiers are removed from the data to ensure that the respondents cannot be traced back to other respondents. Data are stored securely, and access will be restricted to the researchers. Any publications or presentations resulting from the study will use aggregated data with no individual responses disclosed, safeguarding the identity and privacy of all respondents.
