	This chapter outlines and expands upon the research methodology for the design and implementation of a shelter location-allocation system using a genetic algorithm for the optimization of shelter placement in disaster-prone areas. This methodology provides a systematic approach for a clear framework for system design, model implementation, and evaluation. Following this, data collection procedures are explained including the sources and techniques for gathering essential data on community demographics, geographic information, and shelter facilities.
	
	Additionally, the chapter addresses the criteria for the selection of area and population, techniques for analyzing data, and the metrics used to evaluate the system’s acceptability; ethical considerations such as data privacy are also discussed. Finally, The study’s potential limitations are also acknowledged, offering insight into areas for future investments.
