\section{Statement of the Problem}

This study aims to address the shelter allocation problem for the municipality of Hagonoy, particularly during disaster situations such as storm surges and flash floods. The primary challenge is how to model and solve the location-allocation problem to ensure that victims are allocated to shelters in an optimal manner. Specifically, the paper aims to solve the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the optimal shelter allocation for the municipality of Hagonoy?
	\item How the system will be developed featuring the following functionalities:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Data Modification,
		\item Data Simulation,
		\item Shelter Tagging, and
		\item System Security?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item How acceptable will the proposed system be based on criteria of ISO / IEC 25010?
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Functional Suitability,
		\item Performance Efficiency,
		\item Compatibility,
		\item Interaction Capability,
		\item Reliability,
		\item Security,
		\item Maintainability,
		\item Flexibility,
		\item Safety?
	\end{enumerate}
