\section{RRL Topic 2}

Discuss what the following RRL is about, emphasizing the unifying theme of this set RRL's. Remember, a good literature review doesn’t merely summarize sources-—it critically evaluates and synthesizes existing knowledge to provide a clear picture of the state of the field. By doing so, you demonstrate your familiarity with the topic, position your work in relation to other researchers, and show how your research addresses gaps or contributes to ongoing debates

\begin{longtable}{|L{.2\linewidth}|L{.74\linewidth}|}
	\hline
	\multicolumn{2}{|L{.94\linewidth}|}{\fullcite{ThesisTag}}\\ \hline
	\textbf{Summary.} & Provide a summary of the reference. Highlight the main findings, methodologies, and conclusion of this work.\\ \hline
	\textbf{Critique.} & Critique the strengths and limitations of the reference. Consider aspects like research design, sample size, data collection methods, and statistical analyses. For the developed system, consider software development methodologies, usability and user experience, security and privacy, and case studies of successful system implementations. Discuss any biases or gaps you identify.\\ \hline
	\textbf{Similarities and Differences.} & Compare and contrast the findings and methodologies of past studies with your own research. What aspects align with your work, and where do you diverge?\\ \hline
\end{longtable}
