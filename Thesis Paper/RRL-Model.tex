	\multicolumn{2}{|L{.94\linewidth}|}{\fullcite{Panchalee2021}}\\ \hline
	\textbf{Summary.} & The paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model for shelter location-allocation in response to humanitarian relief logistics. The model aims to minimize total cost, evacuation time, and the number of open shelters. The Epsilon constraint EC method and Goal programming GP are used to solve the model. A case study about the flooding in Surat Thani in Thailand is used to validate the applicability of the proposed model.\\ \hline

	\multicolumn{2}{|L{.94\linewidth}|}{\fullcite{Yiying2022}}\\ \hline
	\textbf{Summary.} & The paper proposes a multi-objective location decision-making model for emergency shelters that prioritizes the subjective evaluation of residents. The subjective scores of residents for each attribute are obtained using a combination of normal distribution, ordered weighted aggregation OWA operator, and analytic hierarchy process AHP.\\ \hline
	\textbf{Critique.} & The paper assumed the subjective scores of residents for each attribute as independent. The model does not consider the capacity constraint of emergency shelters which is an important factor in shelter location allocation.\\ \hline
	\textbf{Similarities and Differences.} & Compare and contrast the findings and methodologies of past studies with your own research. What aspects align with your work, and where do you diverge?"The paper is relevant to shelter location allocation as it proposes a multi-objective model that can be solved using genetic algorithms. The paper differs in the use of the combination of normal distribution, OWA operator, and AHP to obtain the subjective scores of residents, whereas genetic algorithm-based models typically use fitness function to evaluate the quality of solutions. Additionally, the paper does not use genetic algorithms to solve the model.\\ \hline

	\textbf{Summary.} & The study focuses non formulating a Complex Non-linear Diophantine Fuzzy (CN-LDF) decision-making model  and apply it on earthquake shelter construction. They discuessed the preliminaries for understanding these concepts and compare the existing models to their proposed models. The approach was applied in a case study on emergency earthquake shelter material selection, where plastic sheeting emerged as the best option.\\ \hline

	\textbf{Summary.} & The study investigates the distribution and redistribution of relief goods in post-disaster scenarios, focusing on Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and Network Flow Problem (NFP) structures while emphasizing fairness in distribution.
