\section{Synthesis of the Review}

Overtime, the researchers have reviewed and analyzed multiple literatures and studies that relate to the thesis. These range from literature and studies that cover different areas using differing allocation techniques as well as other formulae and algorithms that may be used in the thesis. However, a large amount of this literature and studies lack a system or other feature that is partly required for the usability of the end-user. By studying these collected pieces of literature, the researchers aim to create a system with enough improvements from the previous studies presented. Moreover, this thesis will base most of the system and algorithms from the ongoing research in UP Diliman.
