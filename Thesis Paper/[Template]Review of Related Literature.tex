	Over the years, different types of models have been developed for shelter location-allocation to support evacuation efforts, each with distinct objectives and often integrated with simulation programming. This chapter delves into key theories in modeling and system integration that inform the development of effective shelter location-allocation systems. A comprehensive review of related literature is conducted, analyzing and synthesizing existing studies to highlight their relevance, explore the current models, and identify areas where system features are lacking.
